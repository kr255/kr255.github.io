# Resume hosted on Github @ kr255.github.io

Goal of writing a jekyll application is to save time with updating resumes, saving various copies and having a central point to which all work can be demonstrated. 

* Written as a single static page with transcripts included for both degrees
* Hyperlinks for projects that have repositories present on github
* Somewhat modular structure for future variations of the same page
* A separate About Me page instead of an objective line.

Hopefully in the future it can host/point to running examples of previous work.
